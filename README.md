# History

This is not the only version of TCHS that has been made. Plenty of people have made other versions over the years. But this is probably the most detailed version.

The original map started off as a bored summer project by Derek L. in the summer of 2019.

After quarantine started in March 2020, the world file was shared and worked on my Derek L, Connor D, and Daniel K. Connor hosted the server on his laptop and it was worked on collaboratively.

Over the next few weeks, dozens of people were added and worked on the school. The server moved over to a paid server paid for by Connor. Progress slowly stopped as school ended.

The current iteration more or less stopped early summer 2020. Since then, TC has gone over minor renovations as of Winter 2020. These will not be reflected in the build.

So many people worked on this and it was quite a few months ago. I forgot most of the other contributions. Many people worked on it that I never even knew. If you want me to add them, you should know me, so dm me. If you want me to remove your name or replace it with another name, or make corrections, you can also message me.

Feel free to add on the project, just take best efforts to credit. If you can, please branch off the project to show changes.
